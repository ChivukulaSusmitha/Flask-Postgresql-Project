1.Flask App Initialization:
An instance of the Flask web application is created.
The Flask app instance is named app.

2.Secret Key Configuration:
A secret key is set for the application using app.secret_key.
The secret key is a security measure used for session management.

3.Session Lifetime Configuration:
The lifetime of a permanent session is configured to be 10 minutes using app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'].

4.Cookie Timeout Configuration:
A global variable COOKIE_TIME_OUT is defined to set the timeout for cookies.
By default, it is set to 5 minutes, but there's a commented-out alternative with a 7-day timeout.

5.MySQL Database Configuration:
An instance of the MySQL class (mysql) is created for managing the MySQL database connection.
MySQL database configurations, such as user, password, database name, and host, are set using app.config.

6.Routes and Views:
The application defines several routes and views using the @app.route decorator.
The routes include the root URL (/), the login URL (/login), the form submission URL (/submit), and the logout URL (/logout).
Views include functions like index, login, login_submit, and logout to handle these routes.

7.User Session Handling:
The session object is used to store and retrieve user session information.
The index route checks if the user is logged in by checking if the 'email' key is in the session.

8.Login Form Handling:
The /login route renders an HTML template for user login.
The /submit route handles form submissions from the login page.
It checks if the user credentials are valid, and if so, logs the user in.
Optionally, it sets cookies to remember the user.

9.Cookie Handling:
The application uses cookies to remember user details.
It checks for the presence of cookies, and if found, attempts to log in the user using stored credentials.

10.Logout Handling:
The /logout route removes the 'email' key from the session, effectively logging the user out.

11.Application Run:
The application runs in debug mode if executed directly (if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True))
