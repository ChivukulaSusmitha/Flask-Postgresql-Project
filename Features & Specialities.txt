Modular Code Structure:

The code is organized into modules for better readability and maintainability.
Each module has a specific responsibility (e.g., configuration, database models, routes).

User Authentication and Session Management:

The application includes a simple user authentication system.
Session management is used to keep track of user logins.

Database Integration with SQLAlchemy:

The application uses SQLAlchemy for database operations.
Models are defined as Python classes, and the code follows an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) approach.

Secure Short Link Generation:

The secrets module is used to generate secure and random short codes for short links.

Flash Messages for User Feedback:

Flash messages are used to provide feedback to users about the success or failure of operations.

Link Expiration Feature:

Short links are associated with an expiration date to control their validity.
This ensures that short links have a limited lifespan, improving security and resource management.

Clear Route Handling:

Routes are clearly defined in routes.py, making it easy to understand the flow of the application.
Each route corresponds to a specific functionality, enhancing code organization.

Database Initialization on App Start:

The application initializes the database when started, ensuring that the required tables are created.
Use of Config File for Settings:

Configuration settings are stored in a separate file (config.py), making it easier to manage and customize application settings.

Potential for Future Enhancements:

The modular structure allows for easy extension and modification of the application.
Future enhancements, such as additional features or improvements, can be implemented with relative ease.
