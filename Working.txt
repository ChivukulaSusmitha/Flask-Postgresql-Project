User Authentication:

Users can log in using a username and password.
Passwords are not stored directly; you should consider adding a password hashing mechanism for production use.

Session Management:

The session object is used to store and retrieve the user's session information.
If a user is logged in, their user_id is stored in the session.

Database Models:

Two main models are defined in models.py: User and ShortLink.
User model stores user information for authentication.
ShortLink model represents short URLs with attributes such as original_url, short_code, user_id, created_at, and expiration_date.

Short Link Generation:

Short links are created with a random short code of length 5 using the generate_short_code function.
The short links are associated with the user who created them.

Link Expiration:

Short links have an expiration_date field, and by default, they are valid for 48 hours.
The is_valid method of the ShortLink model checks if the link is still valid based on the expiration date.

Route Handling:

Routes are defined in routes.py, handling operations such as home, login, logout, link creation, and analytics.
The home route displays the dashboard if a user is logged in; otherwise, it prompts the user to log in.

Flashing Messages:

Flash messages are used to provide feedback to users.
Different categories of messages (success, error, info) are used for clear communication.

Separation of Concerns:

Code is organized into separate files (config.py, models.py, routes.py, and app.py) for better maintainability.
Database models (User and ShortLink) are defined in models.py.

Database Initialization:

The db.create_all() method in app.py initializes the database based on the defined models.
